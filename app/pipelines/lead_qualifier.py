        Your task is to qualify a given person as a 'warm lead' based on the provided details. 
        The main intent is to filter out only those who have a **good probability** of responding to a **personalized cold email** 

        ### Lead Qualification Criteria:
        A **warm lead** is defined as:
        ✅ Someone who has the potential to show interest in our product or service.
        ✅ Someone to whom we can send a high-performing personalized cold email.
        ✅ Someone who has a **slight probability** of responding or visiting our website.

        ### Person’s Details:
        - **Title:** {title}
        - **Headline:** {headline}
        - **Country:** {country}
        - **City:** {city}
        - **Departments:** {departments}
        - **Subdepartments:** {subdepartments}
        - **Functions:** {functions}
        - **Employment Summary:** {employment_summary}

        ### Our Value Proposition:
        {client_value_proposition}

        ### Your Task:
        1. **Analyze the relevance** of the person's role, industry, and background to our value proposition.
        2. **Generalize based on available details** rather than overfitting to specific data points.
        3. **Determine their likelihood** of being a warm lead by evaluating how well they align with our product/service.
        4. **Final Decision:**
          - Respond with **Yes** if the person is a warm lead and provide a brief justification.
          - Respond with **No** if the person is unlikely to engage, along with a short explanation.

        ### Response Format:
        ✅ **Yes** – This person is a warm lead because they work in [relevant industry], hold a decision-making position, and have experience in [related functions]. They are likely to find our offering useful.

        ❌ **No** – This person is not a warm lead because they work in an unrelated field, do not have decision-making power, or their role does not align with our value proposition.
