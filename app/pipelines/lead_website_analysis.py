    ### Task: Extract Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) from Website Content

    #### **üîç Objective**
    Analyze the **company's website** to extract its **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)** based on **industry, market positioning, and offerings**.  
    The ICP will help retrieve **high-value prospects** from **Apollo.io** for **targeted outreach**.  

    ---

    #### **üö® STRICT Criteria**  
    ‚úî **Primary Source:** Extract ICP attributes **strictly from website content**.  
    ‚úî **Explicit Criteria:** If provided (`{explicit_icp_criteria}`), prioritize it **alongside** website insights.  
    ‚úî **If `{explicit_icp_criteria}` = `"Not available"`, rely entirely on website content**.  
    ‚úî **STRICTLY exclude irrelevant profiles.**  

    ---

    #### **üìå ICP Attributes to Extract**  

    ##### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Job Titles (Minimum 5 - STRICT, No Invalid Responses)**  
    üî¥ **IMPORTANT**:  
    - **ALWAYS return at least 5 job titles**.  
    - If fewer than 5 job titles exist, **infer closely related job titles** from context instead of returning fewer than 5.  
    - If no exact matches are available, **derive general industry-relevant job titles**.  

    ##### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Seniority Levels (Minimum 4 - STRICT, Unique Values Required)**  
    üî¥ **IMPORTANT**:  
    - Extract at least **4 unique seniority levels**.  
    - **DO NOT repeat the same seniority level** (e.g., avoid `["Senior", "Senior", "Senior", "Senior"]`).  
    - If limited seniority data is available, **infer additional relevant seniority levels**.  

    ##### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Geographic Targeting (Minimum 3 - STRICT, Unique Locations Required)**  
    üî¥ **IMPORTANT**:  
    - Extract at least **3 distinct locations** (e.g., avoid `["Dubai", "Dubai", "Dubai"]`).  
    - If the company focuses on a single region, **include broader geographical variations** (e.g., `"Dubai"`, `"UAE"`, `"Middle East"`).  

    ##### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Ideal Company Size - Minimum 3 Ranges (STRICT)**  
    - **Extract at least 3 distinct company size tags** (e.g., `'1-10'`, `'11-50'`, `'51-200'`).  

    ---

    #### **‚úÖ Extraction Guidelines**  
    ‚úî **Website content is the primary source.**  
    ‚úî If `{explicit_icp_criteria}` is available, **merge it with extracted insights**.  
    ‚úî STRICTLY **ensure minimum counts for each category.**  
    ‚úî **NEVER return "INVALID" or an empty list‚Äîalways generate the closest possible matches**.  
    ‚úî **Ensure diversity in extracted values (no duplicates within lists).**
